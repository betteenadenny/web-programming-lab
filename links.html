<u>Introduction to web programming</u>
<pre>
Web programming refers to the writing, markup and coding involved in Web development, 
which includes Web content, Web client and server scripting and network security. 
The most common languages used for Web programming are XML, HTML, 
JavaScript, Perl 5 and PHP. Web programming is different from just 
programming, which requires interdisciplinary knowledge on the application area, 
client and server scripting, and database technology.

<u>Generation of dynamic web pages</u>
<pre>A server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an
application server processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, 
parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, 
including the setting up of more client-side processing.

A client-side dynamic web page processes the web page using JavaScript 
running in the browser as it loads. JavaScript can interact with the page 
via Document Object Model, or DOM, to query page state and modify it. 
Even though a web page can be dynamic on the client-side, it can still be 
hosted on a static hosting service such as GitHub Pages or Amazon S3 as long 
as there isn't any server-side code included.

<u>Web Security</u>
<pre>


Web security refers to protecting networks and computer systems from damage to or the theft 
of software, hardware, or data. It includes protecting computer systems from misdirecting or disrupting the services they are designed to provide.

Web security is synonymous with cybersecurity and also covers website security, which 
involves protecting websites from attacks. It includes cloud security and web application security, which defend cloud services and web-based applications, respectively. Protection of 
a virtual private network (VPN) also falls under the web security umbrella.

Web security is crucial to the smooth operation of any business that uses computers. If a 
website is hacked or hackers are able to manipulate your systems or software, your 
website—and even your entire network—can be brought down, halting business operations.

<u>Application Server</u>
<pre>
An application server is a modern form of platform middleware. It is system software that 
resides between the operating system (OS) on one side, the external resources (such as a 
database management system [DBMS], communications and Internet services) on another side 
and the users’ applications on the third side. The function of the application server is 
to act as host (or container) for the user’s business logic while facilitating access to 
and performance of the business application. The application server must perform despite 
the variable and competing traffic of client requests, hardware and software failures, the distributed nature of the larger-scale applications, and potential heterogeneity of data 
and processing resources required to fulfill the business requirements of the applications.
